# Foodtracker


Description of program:
My first program using MYSQL database. Allows user to create tables (using a template for each, which creates a table with several columns containing nutritional info), modify tables by clearing all data, or adding data to tables, deleting tables, and printing out all information on any table that has been created. Updates all information on MYSQL database. Original intention was small-scale database for less than 10 people that can collect nutritional data from food each user has been eating and store it in database.

Using the program:
When you run the program you will be prompted by a menu system. From this menu system you can then create a new table, add data to an existing table, view an existing table, clear all data from a table, or delete the table, along with an exit option that breaks out of the program. If you choose to create a new table, it will use a default format containing several columns of things like "calories, carbohydrates, protein" etc. When you go to add data to a table, you will be prompted several times individually to input the name of the food, and input several integers for the nutritional values of the food. All of the other menu options are pretty self explanatory. View table prints out the table from MYSQL database, clear table clears all data from table after a confirmation message and delete table deletes the table from database after a confirmation message.
